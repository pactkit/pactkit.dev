description: 10 skill tools powering the PDCA workflow
---

PactKit includes 10 skills — modular tools that agents invoke during workflows. Skills can be called directly (e.g., `/pactkit-draw`) or are auto-invoked by commands at the right moment.

| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Scripted** | 3 | Python scripts with executable logic |
| **Prompt-only** | 7 | Prompt templates embedded in PDCA commands |

## Scripted Skills

These skills include executable Python scripts alongside their prompt definitions.

### pactkit-visualize

Code dependency graph generator using Mermaid format.

| Mode | Output | Diagram Type |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `--mode file` | `code_graph.mmd` | Module import relationships |
| `--mode class` | `class_graph.mmd` | Class diagram with inheritance |
| `--mode call` | `call_graph.mmd` | Function-level call graph |

Options: `--entry <func>` for BFS tracing, `--focus <module>` for module-scoped analysis, `--depth N` for large codebases.

```bash
visualize                            # File-level dependency graph
visualize --mode class               # Class diagram
visualize --mode call --entry main   # Call chain from main()
visualize --focus auth --depth 2     # Focused graph, 2 levels deep
```

Output: `docs/architecture/graphs/`

### pactkit-board

Sprint Board atomic operations on `docs/product/sprint_board.md`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `add_story ITEM-ID "Title" "Task A\|Task B"` | Add a new story to the Sprint Board |
| `update_task ITEM-ID "Task Name"` | Mark a task as done |
| `archive` | Move completed stories to `docs/product/archive/` |
| `list_stories` | View current stories |
| `update_version VERSION` | Update version number |
| `snapshot "vX.Y.Z"` | Save architecture graphs to `docs/architecture/snapshots/` |
| `fix_board` | Relocate misplaced stories to correct sections |

### pactkit-scaffold

File scaffolding for standardized project files.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create_spec ITEM-ID "Title"` | Scaffold a Spec file in `docs/specs/` |
| `create_test_file src/module.py` | Generate corresponding unit test |
| `create_e2e_test ITEM-ID "scenario"` | Scaffold an E2E test |
| `git_start ITEM-ID` | Create a git branch with naming convention |
| `create_skill name "Description"` | Scaffold a new skill directory |

## Prompt-only Skills

These skills provide prompt templates that are embedded into PDCA commands. They can also be invoked directly.

### pactkit-trace

Deep code tracing and execution flow analysis. Produces Mermaid sequence diagrams and an archaeologist report.

```
/pactkit-trace "How does the login flow work?"
```

**Embedded in**: `/project-plan` (Phase 1), `/project-act` (Phase 1)

### pactkit-draw

Generate Draw.io XML architecture diagrams. Supports architecture, dataflow, and deployment diagram types.

When Draw.io MCP server is available, diagrams open instantly in the editor for interactive editing.

```
/pactkit-draw "System architecture overview"
```

**Embedded in**: `/project-plan` (Phase 2), `/project-design` (Phase 2)

### pactkit-analyze

Cross-artifact consistency check between Spec, Sprint Board, and Test Cases. Detects misalignment (missing tasks, scope creep, uncovered ACs) at the cheapest point — before any code is written.

```
/pactkit-analyze STORY-042
```

**Embedded in**: `/project-act` (Phase 0.6, advisory/non-blocking)

### pactkit-status

Project state overview for cold-start orientation. Reports sprint status, git state, and health indicators.

```
/pactkit-status
```

**Embedded in**: `/project-init` (Phase 6)

### pactkit-doctor

Diagnose project health. Checks config, architecture graphs, Spec-Board linkage, and test suite. Includes stale graph detection (7+ days), orphaned/missing spec detection, config drift detection, and severity levels (INFO/WARN/ERROR).

```
/pactkit-doctor
```

**Embedded in**: `/project-init` (auto-check)

### pactkit-review

PR code review with SOLID, security, and quality checklists. Outputs APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES.

```
/pactkit-review 42
```

**Embedded in**: `/project-check` (Phase 4, PR variant)

### pactkit-release

Version release workflow: version bump, architecture snapshot, archive, and git tag.

```
/pactkit-release
```

**Embedded in**: `/project-done` (Phase 3.8, release variant)
