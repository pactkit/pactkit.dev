title: Agent Ensemble
description: 9 specialized agents with constrained roles
---

PactKit deploys 9 specialized agents, each with **constrained tools** and **focused responsibilities**. No single agent can do everything — this enforces separation of concerns.

## Agent Overview

| Agent | Role | Tools |
|-------|------|-------|
| System Architect | Plan phase, Specs, architecture | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob |
| Senior Developer | Act phase, TDD implementation | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep |
| QA Engineer | Check phase, test cases | Read, Bash, Grep |
| Security Auditor | OWASP scanning | Read, Bash, Grep (read-only) |
| Repo Maintainer | Done phase, commits, releases | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob |
| System Medic | Diagnostics, health checks | Read, Bash, Glob |
| Visual Architect | Draw.io diagram generation | Read, Write |
| Code Explorer | Call graph tracing | Read, Bash, Grep, Glob |
| Product Designer | PRD, story decomposition | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep |

## Detailed Roles

### System Architect

Owns the **Plan** phase. Analyzes requirements, maintains the Intent Graph, and produces Specs.

- **Outputs**: Specs (`docs/specs/`), Sprint Board entries, architecture diagrams
- **Cannot**: write implementation code, run tests, make git commits
- **Protocol**: Visual scan → Logic trace → Design → Spec → Board entry

### Senior Developer

Owns the **Act** phase. Implements code per Spec with strict TDD.

- **Outputs**: Implementation code that passes all tests
- **Cannot**: modify Specs, modify Test Cases, make git commits
- **Protocol**: Read Spec → Write tests (RED) → Implement (GREEN) → Verify full suite

### QA Engineer

Owns the **Check** phase and the `docs/test_cases/` directory.

- **Outputs**: Gherkin test cases, PASS/FAIL verdict, issues list
- **Cannot**: modify source code, modify Specs
- **Protocol**: Security scan → Test case gen → Execution → Verdict
- **Runs in plan mode** — must get approval before taking actions

### Security Auditor

Performs OWASP-based security audits. Has **no write access** — can only read and report.

- **Focus**: Injection, broken auth, sensitive data exposure, XSS, access control, misconfiguration, SSRF
- **Outputs**: Security audit report ranked by severity (Critical → Low)
- **Cannot**: modify any code files

### Repo Maintainer

Owns the **Done** phase. Keeps the codebase clean and manages releases.

- **Outputs**: Clean working directory, conventional commits, archive records
- **Cannot**: write feature code, force push main branch
- **Protocol**: Clean → Regression gate → Hygiene → Archive → Commit

### System Medic

Diagnoses project health and repairs broken configurations.

- **Outputs**: Health check report table (Config, Graphs, Spec-Board linkage, Tests)
- **Cannot**: modify business code
- **Protocol**: Verify config → Check graphs → Validate data → Test suite check

### Visual Architect

Generates system architecture diagrams using Draw.io XML format.

- **Outputs**: `.drawio` files (architecture, dataflow, deployment diagrams)
- **Cannot**: modify source code or configuration
- **Max turns**: 30 (focused task)

### Code Explorer

Traces execution paths through static analysis — never runs code.

- **Motto**: "Read little, understand much"
- **Outputs**: Mermaid sequence diagrams, archaeologist reports
- **Cannot**: modify any files
- **Max turns**: 50 (deep analysis), has persistent memory

### Product Designer

Transforms product visions into PRDs and decomposed Stories.

- **Outputs**: PRD (`docs/product/prd.md`), Specs, Sprint Board
- **Cannot**: write implementation code, fabricate market data
- **Protocol**: Parse vision → Generate PRD → Decompose into Specs → Board setup
