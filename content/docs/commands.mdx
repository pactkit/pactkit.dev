## Overview

PactKit provides 9 commands as workflow entry points. Six former utility commands (trace, draw, doctor, status, review, release) are now [skills](/docs/skills) — embedded into the PDCA commands and auto-invoked at the right moment.

| Command | Agent | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `/project-init` | System Architect | Initialize project scaffolding and governance |
| `/project-clarify` | System Architect | Surface ambiguities and produce a clarified brief |
| `/project-plan` | System Architect | Clarify gate → Analyze requirements → create Spec and Story |
| `/project-act` | Senior Developer | Spec lint → Consistency check → TDD implementation |
| `/project-check` | QA Engineer | 8-item security checklist + quality audit |
| `/project-done` | Repo Maintainer | Regression gate → Auto-PR → archive → commit |
| `/project-sprint` | Team Lead | Automated PDCA orchestration |
| `/project-hotfix` | Senior Developer | Fast-track fix bypassing PDCA |
| `/project-design` | Product Designer | PRD generation, story decomposition |

## PDCA Core Commands

### `/project-clarify`

Surface ambiguities before planning. Standalone command or auto-invoked by Plan.

```
/project-clarify "Add user authentication"
```

Runs: ambiguity detection → structured questions (Scope, Users, Constraints, Scale, Edge Cases, Non-Goals) → clarified brief output. The brief can be fed directly into `/project-plan`.

### `/project-plan`

Analyze requirements and produce a Spec.

```
/project-plan "Add user authentication with OAuth2"
```

Runs: **Init Guard** → **Clarify Gate** (auto-detects ambiguous input, generates questions) → visual scan → logic trace (via `pactkit-trace` skill) → design update → Spec creation (with **Spec Lint self-check**) → Board entry.

<Callout type="info">
**Init Guard**: Before proceeding, this command automatically checks for `.claude/pactkit.yaml`, `docs/product/sprint_board.md`, and `docs/architecture/graphs/`. If any are missing, it runs `/project-init` first — so you never have to worry about forgetting to initialize.
</Callout>

### `/project-act`

Implement code per Spec using strict TDD.

```
/project-act STORY-001
```

Runs: read Spec → **Spec Lint Gate** (structural validation — blocks on errors) → **Consistency Check** (Spec ↔ Board ↔ Test Case alignment, advisory) → detect stack → write tests (RED) → implement (GREEN) → lint check → verify suite.

### `/project-check`

Run a comprehensive QA audit with structured security checklist.

```
/project-check
```

Runs: **8-item security checklist** (SEC-1 to SEC-8, PASS/FAIL/N/A) → code quality scan → test case gen → layer decision → execution → Spec alignment → verdict. SEC-1 through SEC-5 failures are classified as P0 Critical. Includes `pactkit-review` skill for PR code review scenarios.

### `/project-done`

Finalize delivery with regression gate and conventional commit.

```
/project-done
```

Runs: cleanup → regression gate → lint gate → HLD consistency check → rules.md invariants refresh → board hygiene → archive → snapshot verification → commit → **Auto-PR** (structured PR body from Spec + test results, with user confirmation). Includes `pactkit-release` skill for version release scenarios.

## Automation

### `/project-sprint`

Run the full PDCA cycle in one command.

```
/project-sprint "Add user authentication"
```

Orchestrates Plan → Act → Check → Done automatically using a multi-agent team. Requires the Opus model.

### `/project-hotfix`

Fast-track fix that bypasses the full PDCA cycle.

```
/project-hotfix "Fix typo in README"
```

Skips TDD and Spec creation. Suitable for typos, configuration changes, and minor fixes.

## Lifecycle

### `/project-design`

Greenfield product design for new projects.

```
/project-design "Build a task management app"
```

Generates PRD, decomposes into Specs, and populates the Sprint Board. Uses `pactkit-draw` skill for architecture diagrams.

### `/project-init`

Initialize project scaffolding and governance structure.

```
/project-init
```

Sets up the directory structure, architecture graphs, initial governance files, and a project-level `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Uses `pactkit-status` and `pactkit-doctor` skills for health checks.
