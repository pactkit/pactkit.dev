## PDCA Core Commands

### `/project-plan`

Analyze requirements and produce a Spec.

```
/project-plan "Add user authentication with OAuth2"
```

Runs: visual scan → logic trace → design update → Spec creation → Board entry.

### `/project-act`

Implement code per Spec using strict TDD.

```
/project-act STORY-001
```

Runs: read Spec → detect stack → write tests (RED) → implement (GREEN) → verify suite.

### `/project-check`

Run a 6-phase deep audit.

```
/project-check
```

Runs: security scan → test case gen → layer decision → execution → Spec alignment → verdict.

### `/project-done`

Finalize delivery with regression gate and conventional commit.

```
/project-done
```

Runs: cleanup → regression gate → board hygiene → archive → commit.

## Automation

### `/project-sprint`

Run the full PDCA cycle in one command.

```
/project-sprint "Add user authentication"
```

Orchestrates Plan → Act → Check → Done automatically using a multi-agent team. Requires the Opus model.

### `/project-hotfix`

Fast-track fix that bypasses the full PDCA cycle.

```
/project-hotfix "Fix typo in README"
```

Skips TDD and Spec creation. Suitable for typos, configuration changes, and minor fixes.

## Analysis Commands

### `/project-trace`

Deep code tracing and execution flow analysis.

```
/project-trace "How does the login flow work?"
```

Produces a Mermaid sequence diagram and an archaeologist report with patterns, tech debt, and key files.

### `/project-draw`

Generate Draw.io XML architecture diagrams.

```
/project-draw "System architecture overview"
```

Supports three diagram types: architecture, dataflow, and deployment.

### `/project-doctor`

Diagnose project health status.

```
/project-doctor
```

Checks: PactKit config, architecture graphs, Spec-Board linkage, test suite.

## Review and Design

### `/project-review`

PR code review with structured report.

```
/project-review 42
```

Reviews with SOLID, security, and quality checklists. Outputs APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES.

### `/project-design`

Greenfield product design for new projects.

```
/project-design "Build a task management app"
```

Generates PRD, decomposes into Specs, and populates the Sprint Board.

### `/project-release`

Version bump, archive, and git tag.

```
/project-release
```

Updates version number, saves architecture snapshot, and creates a git tag.

### `/project-init`

Initialize project scaffolding and governance structure.

```
/project-init
```

Sets up the directory structure, architecture graphs, and initial governance files.
