title: PDCA+ Workflow
description: The Plan-Do-Check-Act lifecycle
---

PactKit's core methodology is the **PDCA cycle** — Plan, Act, Check, Done — with quality gates at every stage.

## The Hierarchy of Truth

Before understanding the workflow, you must understand the governance model:

| Tier | Source | Role |
|------|--------|------|
| **Tier 1** | Specs (`docs/specs/*.md`) and Test Cases | **The Law** |
| **Tier 2** | Tests | Verification of the law |
| **Tier 3** | Implementation code | The mutable reality |

**Conflict resolution**: When Spec conflicts with code, **Spec wins** — modify the code. When Spec conflicts with tests, **Spec wins** — modify the tests. Code is never the source of truth.

## The Four Phases

### 1. Plan (`/project-plan`)

**Agent**: System Architect

The architect analyzes requirements and produces a Spec:

1. **Visual Scan** — run `visualize` to understand current codebase structure
2. **Logic Trace** — if modifying existing logic, run `/project-trace` first
3. **Design** — update the high-level design diagram
4. **Spec** — create `docs/specs/{ID}.md` with RFC 2119 requirements and Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
5. **Board** — add a Story to the Sprint Board

### 2. Act (`/project-act`)

**Agent**: Senior Developer

The developer implements code strictly per Spec, following TDD:

1. **Read Spec** — understand the requirements
2. **Test First** — write unit tests (RED)
3. **Implement** — write code to make tests pass (GREEN)
4. **Verify** — ensure the full test suite passes

### 3. Check (`/project-check`)

**Agent**: QA Engineer

The QA engineer runs a 6-phase deep audit:

1. Security scan (OWASP baseline)
2. Test case generation (Gherkin scenarios)
3. Layer decision (API-level or browser-level testing)
4. Test execution
5. Spec alignment verification
6. PASS / FAIL verdict

### 4. Done (`/project-done`)

**Agent**: Repo Maintainer

The maintainer finalizes the delivery:

1. **Clean** — remove temporary files
2. **Regression Gate** — run full test suite; stop if anything fails
3. **Hygiene** — confirm all Board tasks are checked off
4. **Archive** — move completed Stories to archive
5. **Commit** — conventional commit (`feat(scope): description`)

## Sprint Automation

Run the entire PDCA cycle in one command:

```bash
/project-sprint "Add user authentication"
```

This orchestrates all four phases automatically using a multi-agent team. Requires the Opus model for agent coordination.
