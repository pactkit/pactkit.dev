description: Install and deploy PactKit
---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Claude Code** CLI installed and configured

## Install

```bash
pip install pactkit
```

## Deploy

PactKit offers two deployment modes:

### Expert Mode (Default)

Full-featured deployment with 13 commands, 9 agents, and 3 skills.

```bash
pactkit init
```

This deploys the complete toolkit to `~/.claude/`:

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Global constitution (references 6 rule modules) |
| `rules/` | 6 modular rule files |
| `agents/` | 9 agent definitions |
| `commands/` | 13 command playbooks |
| `skills/` | 3 skill tools with scripts |

### Common Mode

Lightweight deployment with only the 6 constitution rules. No agents, commands, or skills.

```bash
pactkit init --mode common
```

Suitable for teams that want governance rules without the full agent ensemble.

## Other Commands

```bash
# Update (idempotent, safe to re-run)
pactkit update

# Check version
pactkit version

# Preview to custom directory
pactkit init -t /tmp/preview
```

## Upgrade

```bash
pip install --upgrade pactkit
pactkit update
```

The `update` command re-deploys all files. Your custom rules (files without managed prefixes like `01-` through `06-`) are preserved.
