## What is PactKit?

PactKit is an open-source, spec-driven agentic development toolkit for AI coding assistants. It compiles development workflows, role definitions, and behavioral rules into executable **constitutions** and **playbooks** for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

**Name origin**: Pact (契约) + Kit — *Code by Contract*.

The core idea: **agree on specs before writing code, then let agents execute**.

## At a Glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **9 Agents** | Specialized roles with constrained tools |
| **9 Commands** | PDCA-centric workflow entry points |
| **10 Skills** | Visualize, Board, Scaffold, Trace, Draw, Analyze, and more |
| **6 Rules** | Modular constitution modules |

## Quick Start

<Tabs items={['Plugin (Recommended)', 'pip']}>
<Tab value="Plugin (Recommended)">
```bash
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add pactkit/claude-code-plugin
/plugin install pactkit
```
No Python required. Restart Claude Code and you're ready.
</Tab>
<Tab value="pip">
```bash
pip install pactkit
pactkit init
```
Requires Python 3.10+. Supports `pactkit.yaml` for selective deployment.
</Tab>

Then start using in Claude Code:

```bash
/project-plan "Add user authentication"
/project-act STORY-001
/project-check
/project-done
```
